# 🔥 Ashen

Ashen is a rough, quickly made Vulkan renderer using [VkBootstrap](https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap).
I made this renderer to use in my Graduation Work at Howest University of Applied Sciences - Digital Arts & Entertainment.

In this Graduation Work I research single atmospheric scattering, for which I wanted to work in a custom Vulkan Renderer.
<br>
While I initially had the plan to use [Pompeii](https://github.com/Kobazaaa/Pompeii), my other custom Vulkan Renderer, I ultimately decided against it for a few reasons.
Since I would be performing performance tests, I wanted to avoid any possible overhead.
<br>
Pompeii also is "too much" for what I wanted to achieve, and with this new project, Ashen, I can quickly implement a Renderer that doesn't need to be 100% perfect, but just needs to be able to render my implementation of Single Atmospheric Scattering.

## Work in Progress

Right now the renderer is still work in progress, as I'm still working on setting up the infrastructure and main implementation.
